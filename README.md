SANSA RDF Graph Partitioning is a library to perform RDF Graph Partitioning algorithms by implementing SANSA_Stack framework(see http://sansa-stack.net). In the case, [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) files will be transformed as [org.apache.spark.graphx.Graph](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.graphx.Graph) and the algorithms will be performed on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org).

The SANSA-Rdf-Partition-Spark currently supports algorithms provided by following papers:

## Example#1: Semantic Hash Partitioning
Load [N-Triple file](https://github.com/CescWang1991/SANSA-Rdf-Partition-Spark/blob/master/src/main/resources/SilviaClustering_HairStylist_TaxiDriver.nt) to our example and apply a graph partitioning algorithm named Semantic Hash Partitioning. The example graph has in total 465 vertices and 516 edges, which is partitioned into 4 partitions. The number of vertices and edges in each partition are shown in following table.

| PartitionId | Vertices before | Vertices after 1-hop | Edges after 1-hop | Vertices after 2-hop | Edges after 2-hop | Vertices after 3-hop | Edges after 3-hop |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| 0 | 128 | 136 | 75 | 315 | 342 | 315 | 350 |
| 1 | 116 | 226 | 219 | 316 | 361 | 316 | 361 |
| 2 | 127 | 213 | 180 | 307 | 338 | 307 | 348 |
| 3 | 94 | 100 | 42 | 295 | 306 | 296 | 325 |

## Example#2: Path Partitioning
Load [N-Triple file](https://github.com/CescWang1991/SANSA-Rdf-Partition-Spark/blob/master/src/main/resources/Clustering_sampledata1.nt) as example rdf graph. The example graph is shown as follow:
