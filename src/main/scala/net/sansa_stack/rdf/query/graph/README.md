# Sparql To GraphX
This package provide a interface to convert Sparql to GraphX, which aim to use Sparql queries to generate [a property graph](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html#the-property-graph) which is a class of package [org.apache.spark.graphx](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.graphx.package). In this case, we use Apache Jena query engine [ARQ](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/) to parser [SPARQL RDF Query language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), convert basic graph pattern to graph in which the type of vertices and edges are [Node](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/javadoc/jena/org/apache/jena/graph/Node.html). The graph with variables can match target rdf graph partitioned by [graph partition algorithm](../../partition/spark/algo) in parallel and generate solution mappings.
